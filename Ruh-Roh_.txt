Add a driveForSomeTime function that takes the amount of seconds to drive for and a number representing the speed to drive at in miles per second (yeah I know, that's fast).
    - If seconds is negative, zero or no value an Error is thrown.
    - If Miles Per Second is negative, zero or no value an error is thrown.

The function should increment the mileage by the given amount every second until the given amount of time has elapsed.
